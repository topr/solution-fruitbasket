# Tomasz Przybysz - Fruits Basket

The App accepts fruit names as command line arguments. As specified by the exercise description accepted fruit names are:
_Apple_, _Banana_, _Melon_ and _Lime_. Adding any other other fruit to the basket will cause `IllegalArgumentException`.

If no arguments are passed basket remains empty and a total cost Â£0.00 is calculated.

Content of the basket as well as calculated total cost is printed to the system console.

## Assumptions
- prices are defined in pennies and `int` type capacity is sufficient to store them
- `int` capacity is sufficient as well for the total cost of a basket in pennies
- fruit names are case sensitive

## Build
